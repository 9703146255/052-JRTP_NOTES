Monlith Vs Microservices
+++++++++++++++++++++++

Application can be developed in 2 ways

1) Monolith Architecture

2) Microservices Architecture



1) Monolith Architecture
===================

-> If we develop all the functionalities in one single application then it is called as Monolith Application

++++++++++
Advantages [DEV,DEP,PER,TEST,DEB,KT]
++++++++++
1) Development is easy
2) Deployment is easy
3) Performance
4) Easy Testing
5) Easy Debugging
6) KT is easy

++++++++++++++
Dis-Advantages[sw sra]
++++++++++++++
	.	> whole app re-dep

1) Single point of failure
2) Whole Application Re-Deployment
3) Scalability ( Increasing & Decreasing resources based on demand )
4) Reliability (Strong)
5) Availability (Zero Downtime)

2) Microservices Architecture
======================
=> If we develop the functionalities in multiple services/apis/microservice then it is called as Microservices Architecture Based Application.

=> Every Microservice will have its own goal

Advantages [loosly coupled, fast dev, quick rel, no scalability prob, no single point of fail, techno inde][loosly coup, fast dev, quick realease, flexibili,scalable, no single point fail, tech ind
++++++++++

1) Loosely coupled

2) Fast Development

3) Quick Releases

4) Flexibility

5) Scalability

6) No Single Point of failure

7) Technology independence


++++++++++++++
Challenges   [blvtd] ball vathidi
++++++++++++++

1) Bounded context (identifying no.of services to develop)

2) Lot of configurations

3) Visibility

4) Testing is difficult

5) Debugging
