What is Software Development Life Cycle ?
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
SDLC ==> Ref methodology
SDLC ==> Clearly defined==> process of ceating HQSP
SDLC ==> Focussing below Phases



-> The SDLC refers to a methodology

-> SDLC clearly defines ==> the process of creating "high-quality software project"

-> SDLC methodology focuses on below phases of software development


[req ana, plan, design, dev,test,dep,sup]

1) Requirements Analysis						==>		Business analysts, stakeholders

2) Planning										==>		Project managers, team leads

3) Software Design or Architectural design 		==>		System architects, software designers

4) development 									==>		Software developers, programmers	

5) Testing										==>		Quality assurance engineers[QAE], testers	
		
6) Deployment									==>		DevOps engineers, system administrators

7) Support										==>		Helpdesk, technical support personnel


DEV/SIT/UAT/PILOT/PRODUCTION ==> DS-UPP
===================================================
01)	Development (DEV) 					==> 		Developers, development team

02)	System Integration Testing (SIT) 	==> 		Testers, integration team

03)	User Acceptance Testing (UAT) 		==> 		Testers, end-users

04)	Pilot 								==>			Pilot users, technical support team

05) Production 							==> 		Operations team, system administrators









-> We have several methodologies in SDLC

1) Waterfall Model

2) V-Model

3) Spiral Model

4) Agile Model


+++++++++++++
Waterfall Model
++++++++++++++
intro => 1970
it is a first model intro as process model
it is linear or sequential  approch  soft proj
it is follow step by step



-> Waterfall Model introduced in 1970

-> The waterfall Model was the "first model" that introduced as "Process Model".

-> It is a ==> linear or sequential approach 	==>		to develop software projects

-> It is also called as 	==>		step By step approach to develop the projects

-> In this model we will comple one phase then we will move on to next phase

++++++++++++++++++
When to use Waterfall
++++++++++++++++++
Req fixed, budget Fixed, project is small

-> When requirements are fixed

-> When budget if fixed

-> When Project is small




+++++++++++++++++++++++
Dis-Advantages of Waterfall
+++++++++++++++++++++++

-> Risk is high

-> Requirements can't be changed in middle

-> We can't go to previous phase

-> Testing will happen at the end

-> Client involvement is very very less


#################
Agile Methodology
################
it is one of sdlc methodology

it is also called as "iterative and incremental" approach

we can achieve CD/CD

it involves constant colloboration with clients

Continious improve with every phase


-> Agile is one of the SDLC methodology

-> It is a way to manage the project by breaking into several phases

-> Agile is also called as an iterative approach to develop and deliver the project

-> We can achieve continuous development and continuous delivery using Agile Model

-> It involves constant colloboration with stake holders (clients)

-> Continuous improvement at every stage

-> Client Feedback is most critical part in Agile

-> In Agile, Planning, Implementing, Testing and Delivering is a cyclic process


++++++++++++++++
Agile Terminology
++++++++++++++++

Backlog Grooming  : Team meeting==> to identify pending works

Stories  : Tasks (work)

Story Points : Duration to complte the story (3 points - 1 day, 5 points - 2 days, 8 Points - 3 days)

Sprint Planning[sp] : Team meeting to identify "priority stories" to work

Sprint  : Set of stories to complete (Sprint Goal) & Sprint Duration - 2 weeks (10 working days)

Scrum : It is a process   (Daily team meeting to discuss work status - 15 - 20 minutes) 

Retrospective : Review meeting after sprint(s) completed 
				(What went well, What went wrong, achievements, improvements, lessons learnt, new ideas)


###########
Agile Roles
###########

Pro duct Owner : Responsible for Deliveriables

Scrum Master  : Who will manage Agile teams

Tech Lead  : Seniour Team Members (Who will help team members technically)

Team Members : Developers & Testers


*************  Agile Team Size : 7 - 10 members (Industry Standards)  ***************

JIRA Tool[0-ETLA VACHINDI RA,PAI CHES]
#########
PM,BUG REP, WORK ASSIGNH ==> TOOL

-> JIRA is an atlasian company product

-> JIRA is a paid software

Note: We can use trail version of JIRA for practise purpose

-> In companies we will use Paid version of JIRA

-> JIRA is used to "manage project" work

-> We can use JIRA as a "bug reporting tool" also

-> We will create "Stories, Sprints" in JIRA Sofware

-> For Team members, work will be assigned in JIRA software only


##############
JIRA Lab Work
##############

1) Create Trail Account in JIRA

2) Create Project in JIRA

3) Create Stories in Backlog

4) Assign Story Points for each story

5) Add stories to Sprint and Start the Sprint

6) Assign the story to yourself and change story status

		In-Progress
